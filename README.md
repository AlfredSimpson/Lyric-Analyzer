# Lyric-Analyzer v1.0
This is a basic Python program that analyzes lyrics. Initially developed to analyze the subject of lyrics to determine if an artist
was becoming more, or less, concerned with others rather than themselves as a means of sentiment analysis.

Planned updates:
- Choose what you monitor for via user input
- GUI to make this more visually appealing
- Webcrawling
